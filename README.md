# Adsu's Animalese
(Poorly) converts a given string into the language spoken in Animal Crossing.

The Animal Crossing language (known as "Animalese") uses a combination of soft letter sounds to imply a voice.
Not only is this a really cool effect, but it's incredibly versatile. Simply record 26 or so voice lines of saying letters, and you can make the character say virtually anything - well, aurally _suggest_ that at least.

This is a for fun experiment, working with audio in JS. Its very unfinished.

Likely goals if I get around to it:
- Add more letters (obviously) and intonations
- Allow user to enter their own phrase
- Figure out a better method of punctuation
